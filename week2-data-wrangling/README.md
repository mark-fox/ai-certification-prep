# 📊 Netflix Dataset Exploration

This project is part of my 5-week AI engineering prep.  
In Week 2, I focused on **data wrangling and visualization** using the Netflix Titles dataset from Kaggle.

The goal was to practice:
- Cleaning real-world data
- Exploring trends and relationships
- Creating meaningful visualizations
- Documenting insights in a Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Questions Explored

- How many Movies vs TV Shows are available on Netflix?
- What are the most common genres listed?
- How has Netflix's content changed over the years?
- How should we clean or handle missing data?

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (in VS Code)

---

## 📁 Files

- `netflix_titles.csv` — the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- `explore-dataset.ipynb` — full analysis notebook with code, comments, and charts

---


## 📚 Data Source

- [Kaggle Netflix Titles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- How to clean and process real datasets
- How to extract information from text-based columns
- How to create readable charts with Matplotlib
- How to combine Markdown with code to explain findings clearly

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Explore **genre trends by year**
- Visualize **country-based content differences**
- Turn this into a **Streamlit dashboard** (Week 5 maybe?)
