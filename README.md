# 🧠 AI Engineering Prep – 5-Week Project Series

This repository documents my journey through a 5-week self-directed AI Engineering prep program.  
The focus was on **building practical, full-stack AI projects** while learning to use modern tools like Hugging Face, Flask, React, and data pipelines.

---

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### ✅ Week 1: Python Quicknotes Project
**Goal:** Build a small note-deletion script to simulate data handling and CLI workflows.

- Used Python to manipulate a local dataset
- Practiced reading/writing JSON-like structures
- Gained experience with Git workflows and project structure

📁 [`week1-quicknotes/`](./week1-quicknotes/)

---

### ✅ Week 2: Data Wrangling with Pandas + Jupyter
**Goal:** Learn to load, inspect, and clean datasets using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.

- Loaded a CSV dataset and explored it using `.head()`, `.describe()`, etc.
- Practiced virtual environments and Jupyter setup in VS Code
- Annotated notebook with Markdown explanations

📁 [`week2-data-wrangling/`](./week2-data-wrangling/)

---

### ✅ Week 3: Text & Image AI Models (Transformers)
**Goal:** Run pre-trained Hugging Face models locally for text and image inference.

- Used `transformers` and `pipeline()` to run:
  - Text sentiment analysis
  - Image classification (via `Pillow`)
- Created Jupyter notebooks with sample runs and output

📁 [`week3-pretrained-models/`](./week3-pretrained-models/)

---

### ✅ Week 4: AI-Powered API Playground
**Goal:** Build a backend API that exposes AI functionality via HTTP endpoints.

- Created a Flask API to serve Hugging Face models
- Endpoints:
  - `/analyze` – POST JSON for text sentiment
  - `/classify-image` – POST image upload for label predictions
- Tested locally with `requests` and `curl`

📁 [`week4-api-playground/`](./week4-api-playground/)

---

### ✅ Week 5: Final Full-Stack AI Web App
**Goal:** Combine frontend and backend into a real-time, interactive app.

- Built with React (frontend) + Flask (backend)
- Integrated both text and image ML tasks in one UI
- Included image preview, loading indicators, error handling
- Documented with README, GIF demo, and production-ready file structure

📁 [`week5-ai-webapp/`](./week5-ai-webapp/)

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Flask + Flask-CORS
- React (Create React App)
- Git, VS Code, npm

---

## 🌱 What I Gained

- Confidence in building real AI features (not just theory)
- Comfort working with models, APIs, environments, and frontends
- A full-stack portfolio project I can showcase or expand on

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

- [ ] Deploy the final app (Render + Netlify)
- [ ] Add login/auth or user history
- [ ] Keep refining and exploring AI deployment strategies
